Several ml methods for detecting email phishing using machine learning algorithms are included in this notebook. Email phishing is a common problem that can result in large financial losses and stolen personal data. The goal of this research is to develop an automated system that can accurately recognize phishing emails and reduce the likelihood of an attack succeeding. Using feature extraction methods and machine learning models, the proposed approach classifies emails as phishing or spam. The findings of the study show that the proposed method can detect phishing emails with high accuracy and precision. These findings have significant implications for individuals and organizations that use email for professional and personal communication.
